Justification for XML Structure

The structure of the components.xml file is designed to represent a store's inventory of products, specifically focusing on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). The structure is hierarchical and organized to ensure clarity, ease of access, and validation of data. Below is a detailed justification for each element and attribute included in the XML structure:
